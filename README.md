open terminal, in the directory of the project, run "npm i inquirer qr-image" and run.
it should create a "node-modules" pack which is neeeded for the project but not in the project files.(you should create them)

when running the code by "node index.js" in the directory of the project, it asks you to enter a URL. Then, the project creates and saves your input in a "URL.txt" file.

It creates "qr_img.png" file where you can see your qr code as an image.
